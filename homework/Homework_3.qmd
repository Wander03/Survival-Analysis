## 1. Hazard Functions

The following graphs are hazard functions for 4 distributions of $T$. For each one, sketch a possible corresponding cumulative hazard function $H(t)$. Be sure to label the same time points on your sketches as those provided on the graphs of $h(t)$. Notes: In graph (a) $h(t) = 0$ for $0 \leq t \leq 2$, and in graph (c), $h(t)$ is constant for $0 \leq t \leq 0.3$.

## 2. Cumulative Hazard Functions

The following graphs are cumulative hazard functions for 3 distributions of $T$. For each one, sketch a possible corresponding hazard function $h(t)$. Be sure to label the same time points on your sketches as those provided on the graphs of $H(t)$.

![](images/clipboard-1737172411.png){fig-align="center"}

```{r}
hazard_plot <- function(df, letter) {
  ggplot(df) +
    geom_line(aes(x = t, y = cum_hazard)) +
    labs(
      title = letter,
      x = "t",
      y = "h(t)"
    ) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
      panel.grid = element_blank()
      )
}

df_1 <- data.frame(
  t = c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0),
  cum_hazard = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
  )

df_2 <- data.frame(
  t = c(0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0),
  cum_hazard = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40)
  )

df_3 <- data.frame(
  t = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  cum_hazard = c(5, 3.5, 3.3, 3.3, 3.3, 3.3)
  )

p_1 <- hazard_plot(df_1, "(a)")
p_2 <- hazard_plot(df_2, "(b)")
p_3 <- hazard_plot(df_3, "(c)")

## 3. Exam Time Distribution

Let $T$ denote the time taken to finish a certain exam (in hours). The pdf of $T$ is given by:

![](images/clipboard-2860389600.png){fig-align="center"}

where $\theta > 1$. A random sample of students who took the exam yields the following times:

$$
0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.9, 0.8, 0.6
$$

(a) Construct the likelihood function for $\theta$, i.e., find $L(\theta)$, simplifying as much as possible.

    $$
    L(\theta) = \prod_{1}^{10} f(t_i) \\
    = \prod_{1}^{10} (\theta + 1)t_i^\theta \\
    = (\theta + 1)^{10}[\prod_{1}^{10}t_i]^{\theta} \\
    = (\theta + 1)^{10}0.0617^{\theta}
    $$

(b) Find the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$ for the given times.

    $$
    l(\theta) = ln[(\theta + 1)^{10}0.0617^{\theta}] = 10ln[\theta + 1] + \theta ln[0.0617] \\
    l'(\theta) = \frac{10}{\theta + 1} + ln[0.0617] = 0 \\
    \hat{\theta} \approx 2.59
    $$

## 4. Weibull Distribution

Suppose a random sample $T_1, \dots, T_{10}$ is drawn from a Weibull distribution with $\beta = 2$ and $\lambda > 0$ (see notes for the expression of the Weibull pdf).

(a) Construct the likelihood function for $\lambda$, i.e., find $L(\lambda)$, simplifying as much as possible.

    $$
    L(\lambda) = \prod_{1}^{10} f(t_i) \\
    = \prod_{1}^{10} \frac{\beta t_i^{\beta - 1}}{\lambda^\beta}exp[-(\frac{t_i}{\lambda})^\beta] \\
    = 
    $$

(b) Find the MLE for $\lambda$.

## 5. Times to Relapse

The following data consists of the times to relapse of 12 bone marrow transplant patients. Suppose the time to relapse had an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$.

$$
5, 8, 12, 24^+, 32, 17, 16, 17^+, 19^+, 21, 25, 30^+.
$$

where the “$+$” denotes right-censored observations.

(a) Construct the likelihood function for $\lambda$, simplifying as much as possible.

(b) Find the maximum likelihood estimate of $\lambda$ using the sample of observed survival times.

## 6. Kaplan-Meier Estimation

The following times in minutes for 6 Cal Poly students to get ready in the morning are:

$$
60, 12, 35, 30^+, 5, 20,
$$

where the “$+$” denotes a right-censored time for a student who reported that they took at least 30 minutes.

(a) Construct the Kaplan-Meier estimator for $S(t)$ using the observed times to get ready. Sketch a graph of the curve.

(b) Using your answer to part (a), estimate the proportion of Cal Poly students who take longer than 30 minutes to get ready.
